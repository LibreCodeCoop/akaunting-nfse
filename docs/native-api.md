# Native NFS-e API: first fiscal catalog

The module registers `Route::api('nfse', ...)` through the Akaunting
module route macro. The installed Core determines API prefix, domain,
authentication (Basic or OAuth Bearer when enabled), rate limiting, `read-api`
permission and active-company identification. Module routes additionally require
`read-nfse-settings`.

## Read-only national service catalog

- External client: `GET /{company_id}/{api_prefix}/nfse/national-services`
- Browser session: `GET /{company_id}/nfse/national-services`
- Query: optional `lc116` (four-digit service code), `q` (maximum 100 characters),
  and `limit` (integer from 1 through 500, default 50).
- Success: `200 application/json`, `{"data":[{"code":"...","description":"..."}]}`
  containing at most `limit` entries. Without search filters, the first
  `limit` official entries are returned. A one-character nonempty search without
  an LC code returns an empty array.
- Invalid LC code, non-scalar query, invalid limit or excessive query: `422
  application/json` with empty `data`.
- Access denial: Core-controlled 401 or 403 JSON with `Accept: application/json`.
- The API prefix and Core API version remain configured by Akaunting, rather
  than a new module-owned authentication or version scheme.

Both routes call the **same** controller, using `nfse-php`'s
`OfficialDomainCatalog`. The existing fiscal item assistant uses the
browser-session route; it does not handle Basic passwords or Bearer tokens.
The national-code selector loads its complete bounded catalog from
`GET /{company_id}/nfse/national-services?limit=500` after rendering the form;
Blade supplies only the previously selected code. Both the initial selector
and the on-demand assistant therefore consume the same JSON operation.
The two HTTP paths are deliberate security transports, not two domain APIs:
the API group is stateless, whereas the admin group includes session and CSRF.
Do not forward browser cookies into the native API group.

## Fiscal data in native Akaunting item and customer resources

The module extends the Core's existing item and contact API JSON resources via
`App\Events\Api\ResourceShowing`. It does not add another item/contact
CRUD endpoint. The extra `nfse_fiscal_profile` member is returned only when
the authenticated user has the native resource read permission
(`read-common-items` or `read-sales-customers`) **and** `read-nfse-settings`, and the
resource belongs to the active Akaunting company. It is omitted entirely
without the fiscal read permission, and is `null` when no profile exists.

- `GET /{api_prefix}/items/{id}?company_id={company_id}`: `nfse_fiscal_profile` contains
  `item_lista_servico`, `codigo_tributacao_nacional`,
  `codigo_tributacao_municipal`, `codigo_nbs` and `rtc_supply_category`.
- `GET /{api_prefix}/contacts/{id}?company_id={company_id}`: for customers, the member
  contains `municipal_registration` and `legal_name`; other contact types
  retain their native Core representation.

Core controls authentication, native item/contact ACL, tenant routing and CRUD
operations. The module's existing fiscal listeners persist item/customer
attributes within the native Core create/update jobs. Browser forms continue
using their existing authenticated native Core form routes; fiscal catalog
lookups use the session-protected JSON transport described above. No external
API credentials are placed in HTML or JavaScript.

No new fiscal mutation route is introduced by the catalog foundation. Future
fiscal mutations require operation-level ACL, tenant and object checks, CSRF
for session-authenticated writes, idempotency and negative integration tests.
The native Core API remains unchanged.

## Read-only emission attempt history

The existing fiscal attempt journal supports both HTTP transports using the same controller:

- External: `GET /{company_id}/{api_prefix}/nfse/invoices/{invoice_id}/emission-attempts`
- Browser: `GET /{company_id}/nfse/invoices/{invoice_id}/emission-attempts`

The native Core API requires its own authentication and `read-api` along with `read-sales-invoices`. The browser continues to use the admin session. Both responses contain up to 100 newest attempts for an invoice owned by the active company, without raw XML or full transmitted documents. A fiscal attempt is distinct from an issued NFS-e receipt and from the Akaunting commercial invoice.


## Fiscal ledger and receipt-scoped authorized artifacts (#503)

`GET /{company_id}/{api_prefix}/nfse/ledger` uses Akaunting's native
API authentication plus `read-sales-invoices` and returns bounded
`data` / `meta` pagination of fiscal receipts owned by invoices in
the authenticated company. This does not duplicate the native
accounting invoice resource. Query parameters are:
`status` (`all`, `emitted`, `processing`, `cancelled`, `substituted`),
`search`, `from`/`to` (YYYY-MM-DD), `limit` (1..100, default 25),
and `page`. Invalid filters receive 422; no raw XML or artifact path
is embedded in list responses.

The administrative browser consumes the same
`FiscalLedgerApiController::index` JSON contract via
`GET /{company_id}/nfse/ledger/data` using its existing session;
the HTML route renders only filters, presentation and translated labels.

To download the **selected** authorized fiscal receipt, rather than a
possibly newer receipt of the same commercial invoice, clients use
`GET /{company_id}/{api_prefix}/nfse/receipts/{receipt}/artifacts/{artifact}`
where artifact is `xml` or `danfse`. The native endpoint reuses
`InvoiceController::downloadLedgerArtifact` under the same company and
invoice-read permission checks. Invalid artifact kinds return JSON 422,
unavailable artifacts return 409, and successful responses are raw
application XML/PDF streams, not JSON-encoded binary. The browser
continues to use its authenticated session download routes.
Neither request transmits NFS-e or changes document state.
